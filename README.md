# Bike-Share Simulation
A small simulation of a bike-sharing system using data from Bixi in Montreal. The simulation produces a visualization of the bikes moving from station to station across Montreal, and then reports some statistics once it has ended.

The simulation should be able to identify potential improvements to the system; for example, we may see that the average number of rides leaving one particular station is much lower than the average for other stations, so perhaps we could move the station into an area with a greater demand for bikes.

This will allow us to determine decisions such as determining where to put stations most effectively, how many bikes each station should be capable of storing, how many bikes the system overall needs, and where the bikes should be placed at the start of each day.
